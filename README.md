**FC-Planner** is a highly efficient planning framework tailored for fast coverage of large and complex 3D scenes. Both the simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the superior system simplicity and performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art ones.

Please kindly star ‚≠êÔ∏è this project if it helps you. We take great efforts to develop and maintain it üòÅ.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Prerequisite:**
* ROS Noetic (Ubuntu 20.04) or ROS Melodic (Ubuntu 18.04)
* PCL 1.7+ (1.10.0 Recommended)
* Eigen 3.4+ ([3.4.1](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/cfengag_connect_ust_hk/ES7krJtO3E1Oh4wY0-Wcr-gBDZ3dWz9bpbFNKp6Yhpn3Yg?e=mfiKrO) Recommended)
* Boost 1.71.0
```shell
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install cpufrequtils
  sudo apt install libompl-dev
```

The project has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (ROS Noetic) and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (ROS Melodic). Directly clone our package (using ssh here):

**1) caktin tools (Recommended)**
```shell
  git clone git@github.com:HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FC-Planner.git
  cd FC-Planner
  catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  catkin build --cmake-args -Wno-dev
  cd src/hierarchical_coverage_planner/solution/LKH
  make
```
If you have installed ***Anaconda***, please use ```catkin build --cmake-args -Wno-dev -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3```.
Tips: You can use ```ccache``` to accelerate compilation.
```shell
sudo apt-get install ccache
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache
catkin build --continue-on-failure
```

**2) caktin make**
```shell
  git clone git@github.com:HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FC-Planner.git
  cd FC-Planner
  catkin config -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  catkin_make --cmake-args -Wno-dev
  cd src/hierarchical_coverage_planner/solution/LKH
  make
```
If you have installed ***Anaconda***, please use ```catkin_make --cmake-args -Wno-dev -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3```.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run ```Rviz``` for coverage flight visualization and open another terminal for running the simulation:
```shell
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
cd FC-Planner
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch hierarchical_coverage_planner rviz.launch
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch hierarchical_coverage_planner mbs.launch
```
Trigger the quadrotor to start planning by the ``2D Nav Goal``, then ``2D Pose Estimate`` to start coverage flight as shown in the left gif. More scenes are provided in ```src/hierarchical_coverage_planner/launch```
<p align="center">
  <img src="misc/mbs.gif" width = 400 height = 240/>
  <img src="misc/mbs_recon.gif" width = 400 height = 240/>
</p>

Afterwards, you will obtain the discrete trajectory in ```src/hierarchical_coverage_planner/solution/Traj/TrajInfoMBS.txt```. You can use this coverage trajectory to capture the images of the target, and then reconstruct it. The detailed step can be found in [vis tool doc](./FC-Planner/vis_tool/README.md). The reconstruction result is depicted in the right gif.

#### ‚Ä¢ Use in Your Application

If you have successfully run the simulation and want to use FC-Planner in your project, please explore the launch files in ```src/hierarchical_coverage_planner/launch```. Important parameters that may be changed in your usage. Notably, FC-Planner accepts ***surface point cloud*** as input, so you may be careful about the type of your data.

#### ‚Ä¢ Information of Your Device
When you run the launch file, you will see detailed environment of your platform at the beginning of terminal outputs, *e.g.*,

## üîå Plug-in Packages

For the benefit of the community, we modularize the whole project and extract two important functions (space decomposition and viewpoint generation) as plug-in packages for your use.

#### ‚Ä¢ Skeleton-based Space Decomposition (SSD)

The individual package of SSD is given for your purposeful usage, where some example scenes are provided in ```src/rosa/launch```.

Run ```Rviz``` for SSD visualization and open another terminal for SSD execution:
```shell
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
cd FC-Planner
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch rosa rviz.launch
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch rosa ${SCENE}.launch (e.g., redbird.launch)
```

Afterwards, you will see the SSD results of HKUST RedBird in your ```Rviz``` as follows:
<p align="center">
  <img src="misc/redbird.png" width = 60% height = 60%/>
</p>

As for your ***customerized scene*** and ***more details***, you can find in [rosa package doc](FC-Planner/src/rosa/README.md). 

#### ‚Ä¢ Iterative Updates of Viewpoint Pose

Here we provide an independent package of finding the minimal viewpoint set for a given area needed to cover, *i.e.*, our proposed ***Iterative Updates of Viewpoint Pose***.

Specifically, we give a 3D case guided by skeleton. Run ```Rviz``` for visualization and open another terminal for viewpoint generation execution:
```shell
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
cd FC-Planner
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch viewpoint_manager rviz.launch
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch viewpoint_manager mbs.launch
```

Afterwards, you will see the viewpoint generation results of Marina Bay Sands in your ```Rviz``` as follows:
<p align="center">
  <img src="misc/iterative_updates.png" width = 80% height = 60%/>
</p>

You can also use other guidance to generate viewpoints, *e.g.*, normals. For example, we give a 2.5D case (indoor office) using normal guidance to generate viewpoints.
```shell
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
cd FC-Planner
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch viewpoint_manager rviz_normal.launch
source devel/setup.zsh && roslaunch viewpoint_manager normal.launch
```

Afterwards, you will see the viewpoint generation results of this 2.5D case in your ```Rviz``` as follows:
<p align="center">
  <img src="misc/2.5D_case.png" width = 80% height = 60%/>
</p>

For more usage details, you can find in [viewpoint manager doc](./FC-Planner/src/viewpoint_manager/README.md).
